# Parser

A parser library to read complex objects

## What's in the package?

Well, let me tell you!

* `ava` and `sinon` for tests
* `nyc` for code coverage
* `eslint-watch` for linting
* `npm run` scripts for the above, so you won't have to install any global packages while authoring your module (I hate global modules, *grr*)
* `.travis.yml` for CI

## `npm run` scripts

* `npm run test`: Runs tests once
* `npm run test:watch`: Runs tests in watch-mode
* `npm run lint`: Lints the code once
* `npm run lint:watch`: Lints the code in watch-mode
* `npm run cover`: Runs code coverage using `nyc` (`istanbul`)
* `npm run coveralls`: Used by coveralls
* `npm run do-publish`: Used when publishing the package.
